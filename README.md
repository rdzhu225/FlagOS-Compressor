# FlagOS-Compressor

FlagOS-Compressor converts and quantizes HuggingFace `safetensors` checkpoints.
Its INT4/INT8 command supports module-level selection: selected weights are
quantized, while other low-precision weights are converted to BF16.

## Install

```bash
pip install -e .
```

The official AutoRound package is not required for native quantization. Install
`pip install -e '.[official-autoround]'` only when running the optional official
reference implementation or parity checks.

## Device backends

Five device types have built-in backend names: `cpu`, `cuda`, `npu`, `mlu`,
and `musa`. CPU and CUDA use native PyTorch directly. NPU, MLU, and MUSA load
`torch_npu`, `torch_mlu`, and `torch_musa` respectively only when selected.
Other PyTorch device extensions can be used by passing their registered device
type and `--device`; they are accepted through the generic backend and are not
counted among the five built-ins.

## DeepSeek-V4.1 and MiMo-V2.5 INT8 checkpoints

The scanner reads safetensors headers without loading weight data, including
large Engram embedding shards. Source FP8 block sizes come from `config.json`;
DeepSeek-V4.1 supports 32x32 linear blocks and 1x32 Engram embedding scales.
MiMo-V2.5 fused QKV is decoded using each source TP chunk's scale grid, then
reordered into contiguous Q, K, V rows before quantization. The source TP count
is the global-attention KV-head count, including SWA layers with more KV heads.

```bash
flagos-compressor quantize \
  --input /path/to/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash \
  --output /path/to/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-W8A8 \
  --recipe examples/recipes/linear-int8-bf16-indexer.yaml \
  --backend cuda
```

The same recipe accepts MiMo-V2.5. It selects attention, MoE, MLP, vision/audio
and MTP projections recognized as linear weights. Indexers, state compressors,
embeddings, norms, router parameters and output heads are excluded from INT8.
The recipe decodes their source FP8/FP4 weights to BF16 and removes the source
scales. Existing BF16 and FP32 parameters remain unchanged; INT8 weight scales
remain FP32. Excluding an indexer from INT8 does not require retaining FP8 storage.
The DeepSeek vision patch projection is Linear and is selected explicitly;
MiMo's Conv3d patch projection is preserved. Large Engram tables are decoded
in row chunks so a complete table need not fit in accelerator memory.

The alternative `linear-int8-preserve-indexer.yaml` recipe explicitly sets
`unselected: {strategy: preserve}` and copies excluded weights **and their scales**
without conversion or renaming. Preserved quantized modules are recorded in
`config.json` under `flagos_source_quantization` and in the manifest under
`preserved_tensors`, together with the original quantization config and block
layouts. The integer projections use the usual compressed-tensors contract.
Loading the complete mixed-source artifact requires model-specific runtime
support for the preserved modules; a stock compressed-tensors loader's
`ignore` list alone does not implement their FP8 computation. Artifact validation
checks storage consistency, not full-model runtime compatibility.

For DeepSeek V4.1 text inference on the CUDA FlashMLA path, the optional
`flagos_source_formats` vLLM plugin reads this contract. It dequantizes preserved
FP8 indexer projections to BF16 at load time and routes grouped INT8 `wo_a`
projections through compressed-tensors' linear kernel. The serialized indexer
weights and scales remain unchanged. Enable it with
`FLAGOS_COMPRESSOR_VLLM_SOURCE_FORMATS=1` and
`VLLM_PLUGINS=flagos_source_formats`; this requires a vLLM build containing
DeepSeek V4.1 support. The adapter does not implement other attention backends
or multimodal inference. BF16 Engram exports carry `flagos_bf16_engram: true`;
the same adapter allocates BF16 tables and gathers them directly, including
TP-sharded CPU offload. It does not re-quantize the table. DP-shared host storage
is not supported for BF16 Engram.

The default unselected policy remains BF16 conversion. Use the explicit preserve
recipe when exclusions must retain their original precision.

## Inspect

```bash
flagos-compressor inspect --input /path/to/model
```

This reports detected weight formats and selectable groups such as `moe`,
`moe.routed`, `moe.shared`, `attention`, `mlp`, and `linear`.

## Per-selector quantization in one command

Assign a complete weight/activation scheme to each part of a checkpoint in one
execution. For example, quantize DSV4 attention to W8A8 and MoE weights to
W4A16:

```bash
flagos-compressor quantize \
  --input /path/to/DSV4-Flash \
  --output /path/to/DSV4-Flash-per-selector \
  --select moe=int4 activation-bits=16 strategy=group group-size=32 \
  --select attention=int8 activation-bits=8 strategy=channel scale-dtype=fp32 \
  --backend cuda
```

Each mixed `--select` clause starts with `SELECTOR=WEIGHT_FORMAT`, followed by
selector-local settings that reuse the existing CLI option names without the
leading `--`: `activation-bits`, `strategy`, `group-size`, `scale-dtype`, and
`chunk-size`. `activation-bits` and `strategy` are required, so groupwise and
per-channel weights cannot be confused. Groupwise INT4/INT8 defaults to group
sizes 32/128 when `group-size` is omitted; channel strategy rejects a group
size. The weight format is explicitly `int4` or `int8`, leaving distinct
`fp4`/`fp8` extension points for future implementations.

Selectors can be a built-in group (`attention`, `moe`, `moe.routed`,
`moe.shared`, `mlp`, or `linear`). Regular expressions continue to use
`--select-name`, for example `--select-name 'model\.layers\.0\..*=int8'
activation-bits=16 strategy=group group-size=64`. Name rules are applied after
built-in target rules, and the last matching rule wins. Global `--exclude` and
`--exclude-name` rules are applied after the local rules.

The legacy homogeneous form remains valid: `--select moe --bits 4`.
Selector-local and legacy selectors cannot be mixed in one command, so no
selection can silently inherit the wrong format.

The mapping is an artifact contract, not a runtime-compatibility hint. If a
DSV4 source FP8 attention weight matches the local `attention=int8` W8A8 rule,
it is converted to INT8 W8A8 storage, including `attn.wo_a`; the planner does not silently
preserve FP8 for a DeepGEMM implementation. Runtime support for consuming that
layout is a separate concern.

The command writes one compressed-tensors checkpoint with a config group for
every requested scheme. A W4A16/W8A8 combination uses the official
`mixed-precision` top-level format and declares `pack-quantized` or
`int-quantized` on each group. DSV4 fused attention and shared-expert runtime
aliases are included. Source-quantized weights that match no rule follow the
existing `unselected` policy and are converted to BF16 by default.

Per-selector mode currently supports MSE W4A16, W8A16, and W8A8. The local
selectors own `weight_format`, `activation_bits`, `scale_dtype`, `strategy`,
`group_size`, and `chunk_size`, so do not combine them with those global
settings.
`--n-candidates`, exclusions, the unselected policy, and backend/device flags
remain configurable. Use `--dry-run` to inspect the resolved plan without
writing the output checkpoint.

## Convert to BF16

```bash
flagos-compressor convert \
  --input /path/to/model \
  --output /path/to/model-bf16 \
  --backend cpu
```

## Quantize selected weights

INT4 (the backwards-compatible default):

```bash
flagos-compressor quantize \
  --input /path/to/model \
  --output /path/to/model-int4 \
  --select moe \
  --method mse \
  --group-size 32 \
  --backend cuda
```

`quantize` directly writes an inference-ready compressed-tensors
`pack-quantized` W4A16 checkpoint and updates `config.json`. There is no
post-quantization conversion step. Unselected source-quantized weights use
BF16 by default.

INT8 weight-only W8A16:

```bash
flagos-compressor quantize \
  --input /path/to/model \
  --output /path/to/model-int8 \
  --select attention \
  --bits 8 \
  --backend cuda
```

INT8 uses symmetric groupwise MSE quantization, BF16 scales, and
compressed-tensors `pack-quantized` int32 storage. Its default group size is
128; override it with `--group-size` when the model shape or runtime requires
a different value. INT4 keeps its existing default group size of 32.

INT8 also supports one scale per output channel:

```bash
flagos-compressor quantize \
  --input /path/to/model \
  --output /path/to/model-int8-channel \
  --select attention \
  --bits 8 \
  --strategy channel \
  --backend cuda
```

Do not pass `--group-size` with `--strategy channel`. Channelwise W8A16 export
stores scales as `[out_features, 1]` and declares `strategy: channel` in the
compressed-tensors config. vLLM's WNA16 routed-MoE path requires group
quantization, so W8A16 channel strategy is supported for ordinary Linear and
shared-expert Linear weights, but rejected for routed experts.

Dynamic per-token W8A8, including routed MoE experts:

```bash
flagos-compressor quantize \
  --input /path/to/qwen3.5-moe \
  --output /path/to/qwen3.5-moe-w8a8 \
  --select linear \
  --bits 8 \
  --activation-bits 8 \
  --strategy channel \
  --scale-dtype bf16 \
  --backend cuda
```

W8A8 uses compressed-tensors `int-quantized` storage: raw signed INT8 weights,
FP32 (default) or BF16 per-output-channel scales, and dynamic symmetric
per-token INT8 activations. Fused routed-expert banks are expanded to the standard
`experts.<id>.<projection>.weight` and `weight_scale` names consumed by vLLM.
W8A8 requires `--bits 8 --strategy channel`; `--group-size` is not accepted.
Use `--scale-dtype bf16` to emit BF16 `weight_scale` tensors.

For fused MoE model types without a registered layout adapter, the CLI can
infer the 3D bank order from a consistent `gate_up_proj` / `down_proj` pair:
`[E, 2I, H]` plus `[E, H, I]` is treated as `[E, out, in]`, while
`[E, H, 2I]` plus `[E, I, H]` is treated as `[E, in, out]`. Every discovered
pair must be complete, valid, and agree on the same order; otherwise
quantization stops instead of guessing.

### GPTQ (AutoGPTQ-compatible)

```bash
flagos-compressor quantize \
  --input /path/to/model \
  --output /path/to/model-gptq \
  --select linear \
  --method gptq \
  --bits 4 \
  --group-size 128 \
  --calibration-data /path/to/calibration.jsonl \
  --backend cuda
```

GPTQ uses AutoGPTQ's running Hessian, Cholesky error feedback, activation
ordering, true-sequential projection groups, and native
`qweight/qzeros/scales/g_idx` packing. Defaults are `desc_act: true`,
`static_groups: false`, `true_sequential: true`, and 1% dampening. The output
contains the standard GPTQ quantization config and canonical GPTQ safetensors
filenames.

### AWQ (AutoAWQ-compatible)

```bash
flagos-compressor quantize \
  --input /path/to/model \
  --output /path/to/model-awq \
  --select linear \
  --method awq \
  --bits 4 \
  --group-size 128 \
  --calibration-data /path/to/calibration.jsonl \
  --backend cuda
```

AWQ uses AutoAWQ's activation/weight grid-search scaling, output-MSE clipping,
asymmetric zero points, and native GEMM packing order. The result has
`qweight/qzeros/scales` tensors and an AWQ quantization config. Native AWQ is
currently W4A16 GEMM with zero points.

### AutoRound (native PyTorch)

```bash
flagos-compressor quantize \
  --input /path/to/model \
  --output /path/to/model-autoround \
  --select linear \
  --method autoround \
  --bits 4 \
  --group-size 128 \
  --calibration-data /path/to/calibration.jsonl \
  --autoround-iters 200 \
  --backend npu
```

AutoRound is implemented natively with PyTorch and does not depend on the
official `auto-round` package. It supports symmetric group-wise W4A16 and
W8A16, learnable rounding offsets, optional min/max tuning, quantized-input
cascading, and single-device execution. Device extensions such as `torch_npu`,
`torch_mlu`, or `torch_musa` are imported only when their backend is selected.
The output uses the established GPTQ tensor ABI for broad loader compatibility,
while config provenance records `algorithm: autoround`; algorithm and packing
are separate internally.

An official AutoRound `config.json` can be imported without installing the
official package:

```bash
flagos-compressor quantize \
  --input /path/to/model \
  --output /path/to/model-autoround \
  --select linear \
  --autoround-config /path/to/official/config.json \
  --calibration-data /path/to/calibration.jsonl \
  --backend npu
```

The bridge recognizes the current public fields such as `scheme`, `bits`,
`group_size`, `iters`, `nsamples`, `seqlen`, and the official historical
spelling `enable_quanted_input`. CLI and recipe values take precedence over
imported values. Exported GPTQ metadata retains official AutoRound-compatible
field names while identifying FlagOS-Compressor as the provider. The optional
official Python entry point is lazy-loaded only for explicit reference/parity
work; normal installation and native execution do not import it.

All calibrated methods execute the original Transformers model definition and
discover decoder blocks through Transformers' no-split contract; they do not
maintain a per-model forward adapter. Transformers-v5 fused expert modules are
temporarily exposed as ordinary per-expert `nn.Linear` modules, so the same
hooks handle dense and routed-MoE models. Routed experts must be selected as a
complete gate/up/down set. Source FP4/FP8 checkpoints are staged as BF16 before
calibration.

Calibration data can use any of these formats (`text` below can be changed with
`--calibration-text-column`):

- `.txt`/`.text`: one sample per non-empty line;
- `.jsonl`: one JSON string or `{"text": "sample"}` object per line;
- `.json`: a top-level list of strings/objects, `{"data": [...]}`, or
  `{"text": [...]}`;
- a Hugging Face dataset name whose selected split contains a string `text`
  column; this form requires the optional `datasets` package.

For example:

```jsonl
{"text": "The first calibration sample."}
{"text": "The second calibration sample."}
```

The default is 128 examples packed into 512-token blocks; use
`--calibration-samples` and `--calibration-seq-length` to change it. Empty
records and examples longer than the configured sequence length are skipped.
Ready-made recipes are in `examples/recipes/`.

Selections can be combined:

```bash
--select moe.routed
--select attention
--select-name '.*\.self_attn\.o_proj\.weight$'
--exclude moe.shared
--exclude-name '.*\.layers\.0\..*'
```

Use `--dry-run` to check the selected tensors before writing weights.

A YAML recipe is also supported:

```yaml
version: 1
bits: 8
activation_bits: 8
strategy: channel
scale_dtype: bf16
method: mse
unselected:
  strategy: convert
  format: bf16
select:
  - moe
  - name: '.*\.self_attn\.o_proj\.weight$'
exclude:
  - name: '.*\.layers\.0\..*'
```

The equivalent per-selector recipe is:

```yaml
version: 1
select:
  - target: moe
    weight_format: int4
    activation_bits: 16
    strategy: group
    group_size: 32
  - target: attention
    weight_format: int8
    activation_bits: 8
    strategy: channel
    scale_dtype: fp32
  - name: '^model\.layers\.0\.'
    weight_format: int8
    activation_bits: 16
    strategy: group
    group_size: 64
```

Recipe fields:

- `version` (int): recipe schema version. Version `1` supports checkpoint-only
  MSE/W8A8, including per-selector schemes. Version `2` is a strict
  superset that adds top-level `format`, `calibration`, `gptq`, `awq`, and
  `autoround`; GPTQ, AWQ, and AutoRound recipes must use version `2`.
- `select` (list): tensors to quantize. Legacy entries are a built-in group or
  `{name: 'REGEX'}` and use the global `bits` setting. Per-selector entries
  have exactly one of `target` (a built-in group) or `name` (a regex), plus an
  explicit `weight_format` (`int4` or `int8`), `activation_bits`, and `strategy`
  (`group` or `channel`). Optional per-entry `group_size`, `chunk_size`, and
  W8A8 `scale_dtype` reuse their top-level meanings.
  Rules are ordered and the last matching entry wins; CLI rules follow recipe
  rules, and CLI `--select-name` rules follow CLI `--select` rules.
- `bits` (int, default `4`): weight bit width, either `4` or `8`. Same as CLI
  `--bits`.
- `activation_bits` (int, default `16`): activation bit width, either `8` or
  `16`. Setting it to `8` enables dynamic-token W8A8 and requires `bits: 8`
  with `strategy: channel`. Same as CLI `--activation-bits`.
- `scale_dtype` (str, default `fp32`): W8A8 weight scale dtype, either `fp32`
  or `bf16`. Same as CLI `--scale-dtype`.
- `strategy` (str, default `group`): `group` or `channel`. Channel strategy is
  available for INT8 Linear weights and for routed experts in W8A8 mode. It
  must not specify `group_size`.
- `method` (str, default `mse`): `mse`, `gptq`, `awq`, or `autoround`.
- `format` (str): output checkpoint ABI. It is inferred as
  `compressed-tensors`, `gptq`, or `awq` from `method` and must agree when set.
  AutoRound currently uses `gptq` packing.
- `group_size` (int, default `32` for INT4 and `128` for INT8): group size
  along the input-feature axis for weight scales. Same as CLI `--group-size`.
- `n_candidates` (int, default `200`): number of candidate scales searched per
  group by the MSE quantizer. Same as CLI `--n-candidates`.
- `chunk_size` (int, default `4096` for INT4 and `1024` for INT8): group chunk
  size used to bound peak memory during MSE search. Same as CLI `--chunk-size`.
- `calibration` (mapping): `data`, `samples`, `sequence_length`, `seed`,
  `split`, `text_column`, and `trust_remote_code` for GPTQ/AWQ.
- `gptq` (mapping): `block_size`, `damp_percent`, `desc_act`, `static_groups`,
  `true_sequential`, and `symmetric`.
- `awq` (mapping): `zero_point`, `version`, `duo_scaling`, `apply_clip`,
  `n_grid`, and `max_chunk_memory`.
- `autoround` (mapping): `iters`, `lr`, `minmax_lr`, `batch_size`,
  `gradient_accumulate_steps`, `momentum`, `enable_minmax_tuning`, and
  `enable_quantized_input`. `official_config` may point to an official
  AutoRound JSON config whose values are used as lower-priority defaults.
- `exclude` (list): tensors to skip, same shape as `select`. Applied on top of
  the `select` set. Mirrors `--exclude` / `--exclude-name`.
- `unselected` (mapping): how source-quantized weights outside the selected set
  are handled. `strategy: convert` (default) with `format: bf16` dequantizes
  low-precision weights to BF16. `strategy: preserve` copies their original
  weights and scales and records the source-format contract. Preserve is
  supported by direct RTN/MSE conversion; calibration-based GPTQ, AWQ and
  AutoRound require BF16 conversion and reject preserve.

Outside per-selector mode, CLI flags and recipe fields are additive: `select`
and `exclude` entries from the recipe are merged with the corresponding CLI
flags, and scalar fields
(`bits`, `activation_bits`, `scale_dtype`, `strategy`, `method`, `group_size`,
`n_candidates`, `chunk_size`)
take the CLI value when provided, otherwise fall back to the recipe, otherwise
to the bit-width-specific default. At least one selector (via
CLI or recipe) is required.

```bash
flagos-compressor quantize \
  --input /path/to/model \
  --output /path/to/model-int4 \
  --recipe quantize.yaml
```

## Validate

```bash
flagos-compressor validate --input /path/to/model-int4
```

Validation checks the checkpoint index, stored tensors, INT4/INT8 metadata,
runtime quantization config, and native GPTQ/AWQ tensor layouts.
